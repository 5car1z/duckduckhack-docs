# How to Make an API-Based Random Person Generator

In this walkthrough, we'll learn how to build a Random Person Spice Instant Answer. It uses the API provided by [Random.me](https://randomuser.me/). You can find the code on [Github](https://gist.github.com/moollaza/0f935d1b11eb66f1f2e8) to follow along.

We've done it as a screencast about for those who enjoy learning from video tutorials.

## Set Up Your Development Environment

To follow along with this screencast, we'll first need to set up our development environment. There are three main steps:

1. Fork the Goodie repository on Github.com. ([How?](https://talsraviv.gitbooks.io/duckduckhackdocs/content/duckduckhack/welcome/setup-dev-environment.html#1-fork-the-appropriate-repository-on-githubcom))
2. Set up the DuckDuckHack environment on Codio.com ([How?](https://talsraviv.gitbooks.io/duckduckhackdocs/content/duckduckhack/welcome/setup-dev-environment.html#2-set-up-the-duckduckgo-environment-on-codiocom))
3. Clone your Github fork onto the Codio environment. ([How?](https://talsraviv.gitbooks.io/duckduckhackdocs/content/duckduckhack/welcome/setup-dev-environment.html#3-clone-your-github-fork-onto-the-codio-environment))

If this is your first time developing an Instant Answer, check out our [detailed, step-by-step guide](https://talsraviv.gitbooks.io/duckduckhackdocs/content/duckduckhack/welcome/setup-dev-environment.html) to getting your development environment set up.
