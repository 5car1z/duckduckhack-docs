# Going Live on DuckDuckGo.com

The most exciting part of hacking on an Instant Answer is launching on DuckDuckGo.com for everyone to enjoy. The search engine serves millions of queries *a day* all around the world, across hundreds of types of devices. 

We'd love for everyone to be able to put their Instant Answer in production - and it's not very difficult at all. In this section, we'll walk you through the process of going live on DuckDuckGo.com.

## The Process

Have an idea? 

**1. Let the community know you're working on something! Use [Slack](mailto:QuackSlack@duckduckgo.com?subject=AddMe) or [email](mailto:open@duckduckgo.com). We're excited to meet you and support you along the way.**

**2. Read the [Instant Answer Production Guidelines](#) and make sure your Instant Answer meets them (we'd love to help)**

**3. [Submit a pull request](#) that meets the [Instant Answer Checklist](#)**

We hope you'll make use of our [walkthroughs](#), [existing live examples](https://duck.co/ia), and the [reference](#) - and let us know if we can improve anything in [these documents](https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo-documentation).

## Feedback and Support

You don't have to figure it all out on your own. We have a great community [on Slack](mailto:QuackSlack@duckduckgo.com?subject=AddMe), as well as at [Meetups](http://duckduckgo.meetup.com) around the globe. If you need help, or want to think out loud, don't hesitate to join in - we're excited to help newcomers. You can always [send an email](mailto:open@duckduckgo.com) if you prefer.

**Let the community know you exist long before your pull request.** The feedback on pull request submissions is mainly pass/fail based on the [Production Guidelines](#), so it's best to have someone in the community help review your work ahead of time for detailed help and feedback.

## Maintaining Your Contribution

Even after submission, we encourage contributors to "own" their Instant Answers. That means getting feedback, improving relevance, refining the query space, and maintaining a good experience.

Some ways to keep tabs include: 

- Check in on your [Instant Answer page](https://duck.co/ia)
- Prod the community for helpful feedback and ideas
- Keep using it :)

Creating and maintaining an Instant Answer is super rewarding. We're excited to do what we can to help.
