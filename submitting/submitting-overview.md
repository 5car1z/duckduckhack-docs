# Going Live on DuckDuckGo.com

The most exciting part of hacking on an Instant Answer is launching on DuckDuckGo.com for everyone to enjoy. The search engine serves millions of queries *a day* all around the world, across hundreds of types of devices. 

We'd love for everyone to be able to put their Instant Answer in production - and it's not very difficult at all. In this section, we'll walk you through the process of going live on DuckDuckGo.com.

## The Process

Have an idea [that no one has done yet](https://duck.co/ia)? Improving an [existing Instant Answer](https://duck.co/ia/dev/issues)? 

**1. [Create an Instant Answer Page](https://duck.co/ia/new_ia) for your idea - or [locate an existing page](https://duck.co/ia).** 

**2. Hack away, keeping the [Instant Answer Production Guidelines](http://docs.duckduckhack.com/submitting/checklist.html) in mind.**

**3. [Submit a pull request](http://docs.duckduckhack.com/submitting/pull-request.html).** Make sure to paste your Instant Answer page URL in your description.

We're excited to meet you and support you along the way - and it's never too early. Say hello on [Slack](mailto:QuackSlack@duckduckgo.com?subject=AddMe) or [email](mailto:open@duckduckgo.com). 

## Instant Answer Pages

To keep track of the hundreds of Instant Answers our community has created, we use **Instant Answer pages**.

Instant Answer pages are the home base for planning, collaboration, and metadata. They make it easy for other contributors to locate your answer, help out, and give you credit. See an [example here](https://duck.co/ia/view/calculator):

You can see an overview of all Instant Answers that are in progress, and live, on the [Dev Overview page](https://duck.co/ia/dev).

## Feedback and Support

You don't have to figure it all out on your own. We have a great community [on Slack](mailto:QuackSlack@duckduckgo.com?subject=AddMe), as well as at [Meetups](http://duckduckgo.meetup.com) around the globe. If you need help, or want to think out loud, don't hesitate to join in - we're excited to help newcomers. You can always [send an email](mailto:open@duckduckgo.com) if you prefer.

**Let the community know you exist long before your pull request.** The feedback on pull request submissions is mainly pass/fail based on the [Production Guidelines](http://docs.duckduckhack.com/submitting/checklist.html), so it's best to have someone in the community help review your work ahead of time for detailed help and feedback.

## Maintaining Your Contributions

Even after submission, we encourage contributors to "own" their Instant Answers. That means getting feedback, improving relevance, refining the query space, and maintaining a good experience.

Some ways to keep tabs include: 

- Check in on your [Instant Answer page](https://duck.co/ia)
- Prod the community for helpful feedback and ideas
- Keep using it :)


Creating and maintaining an Instant Answer is super rewarding. We're excited to do what we can to help.
