# Going Live on DuckDuckGo.com

The most exciting part of hacking on an Instant Answer is launching on DuckDuckGo.com for everyone to enjoy. The search engine serves millions of queries *a day* all around the world, across hundreds of types of devices.

We'd love for everyone to be able to put their Instant Answer in production - and it's not very difficult at all. In this section, we'll walk you through the process of going live on DuckDuckGo.com.

## The Process

Have an idea [that no one has done yet](https://duck.co/ia)? Improving an [existing Instant Answer](https://duck.co/ia/dev/issues)?

1. **Before coding, [create an Instant Answer Page](https://duck.co/ia/new_ia) for your idea.** If you're fixing an existing Instant Answer, [locate its existing page](https://duck.co/ia).
	
	> Remember to check the [dev pipeline](https://duck.co/ia/dev/pipeline) and the [live IA directory](https://duck.co/ia) to see if anyone is already working on something similar. 

2. **Hack away, keeping the [Instant Answer Production Guidelines](http://docs.duckduckhack.com/submitting/checklist.html) in mind.**

3. **[Submit a pull request](http://docs.duckduckhack.com/submitting/pull-request.html).**

	> Make sure to paste your Instant Answer page URL in your description to automatically link the two.

*Submitting a pull request is just the beginning. Learn about [keeping your IA awesome](http://docs.duckduckhack.com/maintaining/guidelines.html).*

## Feedback and Support

You don't have to figure it all out on your own. There are many ways to [reach out and stay in touch](http://docs.duckduckhack.com/resources/get-in-touch.html) if you're looking for help or just want to say hello.

**Let the community know you exist long before your pull request.** The feedback on pull request submissions is mainly pass/fail based on the [Production Guidelines](http://docs.duckduckhack.com/submitting/checklist.html), so it's best to have someone in the community help review your work ahead of time for detailed help and feedback.
