# What Type of Instant Answer Should I Make?

There are two main types of Instant Answers you can develop: Goodies, and Spice.

The difference comes down to a simple question: **do you need to retrieve data from a third party API?**

## Goodie Instant Answers

Goodies **do not retrieve data from a third party API.** Goodies provide their results entirely through server-side code. They may use a [static data file](http://docs.duckduckhack.com/backend-reference/data-files.html) stored on DuckDuckGo's server, but they do not call external resources.

**Cheat Sheets** are a subset of Goodies. [Learn to make a cheat sheet](http://docs.duckduckhack.com/walkthroughs/programming-syntax.html).

You can see examples of Goodies by filtering on the [Instant Answer Directory](https://duck.co/ia).

## Spice Instant Answers

Spices **retrieve data from third party APIs.** Spices provide their results via one or more calls to external endpoints. You can learn more about [how this works here](http://docs.duckduckhack.com/welcome/how-ias-work.html).
