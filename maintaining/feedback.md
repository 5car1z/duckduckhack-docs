# Giving Great Feedback on Instant Answers

We're an open-source community dedicated to making [delightful](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=who%27s+in+space%3F&ia=answer) [search results](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=tennis+cheatsheet&ia=cheatsheet&iax=1) for [everyone](https://duck.co/ia), often with zero clicks. We do this using existing APIs, external data sets, or just some well-placed code.

Our best Instant Answers have evolved as a result of tons of great feedback from passionate users and contributors to our community. No one knows what makes an awesome experience than the people who use an Instant Answer themselves.

## Right Now: Help Us Bang on Programming Instant Answers

Right now our focus as a community is on programming-related Instant Answers. If you want to help improve Instant Answers and point out issues for the community to work on, here's how to get started:

1. First, visit our [Programming Language Coverage Checklist](https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo/wiki/Programming-IA-Coverage) to view potential and existing Instant Answers for programming-related topics.
2. Find a topic that you frequently search, and visit the specific Instant Answer page by clicking the letter(s) inside a box.
3. Click some of the **example queries** to see it in action
4. **Try to break it with other test queries** that you'd expect to be covered
5. Found something unexpected or sub-optimal? Use the "Create Issue" button on the IA page to raise a GitHub issue.

## Things to Look for

- Any issues with interactions on either desktop and mobile? 
- Could this information be surfaced with fewer clicks?
- Are related queries triggering the Instant Answer?  
- How can the developer improve the query space?
- Any typos, errors, or accuracy mistakes?
- Is it fast? APIs should respond in under 1 second. Does this particular Instant Answer display quickly?
