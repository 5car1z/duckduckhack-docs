# Welcome to DuckDuckHack

**If you could hack your search engine to put the best information first, what would you do? **

Instant Answers are an opportunity to create your own results. They appear on DuckDuckGo.com above ads and organic links, which serves [millions of searches](https://duckduckgo.com/traffic.html) every day. 

Most importantly, Instant Answers are created by an open source community of developers [around the world](http://duckduckgo.meetup.com/). Welcome!

## Improve an Already Live Instant Answer

We welcome new contributors to dive in and improve live Instant Answers. It's a great, hands-on way to learn how things work. Start by [setting up your development environment](#).

Have a [favorite Instant Answer](http://duck.co/ia) that you want to make even better? Feel free to dive in. 

We also make sure to identify "low-hanging fruit" for new community members to work on.
