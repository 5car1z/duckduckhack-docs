# Welcome to DuckDuckHack!

**If you could hack your search engine to put the best information first, what would you do? **

Instant Answers are an opportunity to create your own results. They appear on DuckDuckGo.com above ads and organic links, which serves [millions of searches](https://duckduckgo.com/traffic.html) every day. 

Most importantly, Instant Answers are created by an open source community of developers [around the world](http://duckduckgo.meetup.com/). Welcome!

## Improve an Already-Live Instant Answer

We welcome new contributors to dive in and improve live Instant Answers. It's a great, hands-on way to learn how things work. Start by [setting up your development environment](https://talsraviv.gitbooks.io/duckduckhackdocs/content/duckduckhack/welcome/setup-dev-environment.html).

Have a [favorite Instant Answer](http://duck.co/ia) that you want to make even better? Feel free to dive in. 

We also make sure to identify "low-hanging fruit" for new community members to work on. 

- [Goodie Low Hanging Fruit](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Low-Hanging+Fruit%22) (Instant Answers that **do not** make external calls) 
- [Spice Low Hanging Fruit](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-spice/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Low-Hanging+Fruit%22) (Instant Answers that call external APIs)

...in ways we never imagined:

Other Instant Answers channel external sources (API requests):
