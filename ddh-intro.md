# Welcome to DuckDuckHack

**Instant Answers use the Web's best data to solve searches in few or zero clicks. With your knowledge of the Web and a little bit of coding, DuckDuckGo can show the best possible result for the topics you care about most!**

[Instant Answers](https://duck.co/ia) are created and maintained by a community of open source developers around the world so that millions of searches on DuckDuckGo (like [who's in space?](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=who%27s+in+space%3F&ia=answer) and [tennis help](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=tennis+help&ia=cheatsheet&iax=1)) show a perfect result, above any ads or regular links. Just like the Wikipedia community creates articles for topics -- the DuckDuckHack community creates Instant Answers for searches!

1. Use these docs and our help to improve search results for the topics you care about.
2. Join our [dev list](https://www.listbox.com/subscribe/?list_id=197814) to keep in touch with all the latest news and DuckDuckHack events.
3. Become a leader and all-star contributor helping to change the world of search through community!

## Inspiration

Instant Answers allow you to create your own search results. Here are some examples of what contributors have created. You can see [all live Instant Answers listed here](https://duck.co/ia).

Instant Answers can be quite dynamic...

Many are super practical...
