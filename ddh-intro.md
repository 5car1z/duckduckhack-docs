# Welcome to DuckDuckHack

![](http://docs.duckduckhack.com/assets/hack_search_engine.png)

**We're a community dedicated to making DuckDuckGo the best search engine for programmers, and you can help!**

Our goal is to have a high quality, relevant Instant Answer for every search.

Instant Answers are built by leveraging 3rd party APIs and external data sets. The community and DuckDuckGo staff work with developers to make sure the Instant Answer is the best it can be.

## Programming Mission

The Programming Mission is the current focus of DuckDuckHack: improving search for the top 15 programming languages.
For now, we are **only accepting Pull Requests and Issues related to the Programming Mission.**
