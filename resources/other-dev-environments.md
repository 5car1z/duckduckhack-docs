# Other Development Environments

For the vast majority of contributors, the best, simplest, and quickest way to develop on DuckDuckHack is to use the **free, web-based Codio environment**. Instructions on setting up Codio can be found in the section on [setting up your development environment](http://docs.duckduckhack.com/welcome/setup-dev-environment.html).

However, some developers prefer working on either a local environment or a virtual machine. View the [updated instructions](https://github.com/duckduckgo/p5-app-duckpan/blob/master/README.md) for development environments outside Codio.
