# The DDG Visual Regression Tool

The open-source [`ddg-screen-diff`](https://github.com/duckduckgo/ddg-screen-diff) tool helps developers easily compare live screenshots of a given page, search results, or Instant Answer from two different hosts.

The tool produces three images: the two screenshots, **plus a visual diff of the two screenshots**.

For example, you might use this tool to compare live screenshots between your development machine and production, or between beta and production, etc. It also supports multiple browsers.

## Installation and Usage

**The full setup and commands are [documented in the tool's GitHub repository](https://github.com/duckduckgo/ddg-screen-diff).**
