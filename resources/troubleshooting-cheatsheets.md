# Troubleshooting Cheat Sheets

If you have problems or errors while making a cheat sheet, follow these steps to find a fix:

1. Run `duckpan upgrade` in your terminal.
2. Validate your JSON code using [JSONLint](http://jsonlint.com/)
3. Make sure the JSON's ID property is the same as the IA page name (in the URL), e.g. `my_first_cheat_sheet`
4. Make sure the JSON filename is the same as the ID but **without** "cheat_sheet" and that it uses hyphens, not underscores, e.g. `my-first.json`

If you're still having trouble, please either [get in touch directly](http://docs.duckduckhack.com/resources/get-in-touch.html) or submit a pull request to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies) where it will be checked by others in the community.
